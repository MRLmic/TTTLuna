<h4>Planning</h4> <br>

<p> I started planning for the game by creating wireframes and user stories, and reading over the requirements. I kept track of my progress using a Trello board and tried to stick to the recommended schedule.</p>

<p>I learned a lot of lessons about problem solving during this first project. I learned to comment my code in a clear way, to create order-of-operation maps and to make checklists of the requirements for different functionalities.</p>

<h4>Problems To Be Solved</h4>

<p>I would like to update my CSS as other than my game board it could use some work!</p>
