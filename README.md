Planning

I started planning for the game by creating wireframes and user stories, and reading over the requirements. I kept track of my progress using a Trello board and tried to stick to the recommended schedule.

I learned a lot of lessons about problem solving during this first project. I learned to comment my code in a clear way, to create order-of-operation maps and to make checklists of the requirements for different functionalities.

Problems To Be Solved
-I would like to update my CSS as other than my game board it could use some work!
